# Spotify-Danceability-Prediction
A Kaggle Competition which is based on Danceability Prediction based on basic features from Spotify's Database has been launched.
This open-source repository can be used as a guidline for how to handle complex & crowded dataset.
Also Parameter Optimization can be used to understand that how the model accuracy changes with respect to the model tuning.

In this project, given steps are followed:
1)EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
2)Data Processing & Feature Engineering
3)Modeling & Prediction
4)Model Evaluation
5)Hyperparameter Optimization
6)Final Model

Target: Danceability

Models Used:
XGBoost
LightGBM
CatBoost
